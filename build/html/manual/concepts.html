<h1>Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter defines some of the basic concepts that the Buildbot uses.
You’ll need to understand how the Buildbot sees the world to configure it properly.</p>
<div class="section" id="source-stamps">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Source Stamps<a class="headerlink" href="#source-stamps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot uses the concept of <em>source stamp set</em> to identify exact source code that needs to be built for a certain project.
A <em>source stamp set</em> is a collection of one or more source stamps.</p>
<p>A <em>source stamp</em> is a collection of information needed to identify a particular version of code on a certain codebase. This information most often is a revision and possibly a branch.</p>
<p>A <em>codebase</em> is a collection of related files and their history tracked as a unit by version control systems.
A single codebase may appear in multiple repositories which themselves are identified by URLs.
For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-central</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-release</span></code> both contain the Firefox codebase, although not exactly the same code.</p>
<p>A <em>project</em> corresponds to a set of one or more codebases that together may be built and produce some end artifact.
For example, a company may build several applications based on the same core library.
The “app” codebase and the “core” codebase are in separate repositories, but are compiled together and constitute a single project.
Changes to either codebase should cause a rebuild of the application.</p>
<p>A <em>revision</em> is an identifier used by most version control systems to uniquely specify a particular version of the source code.
Sometimes in order to do that a revision may make sense only if used in combination with a <em>branch</em>.</p>
<p>To sum up the above, to build a project, Buildbot needs to know exactly which version of each codebase it should build.
It uses a <em>source stamp</em> to do so for each codebase, each of which informs Buildbot that it should use a specific <em>revision</em> from that codebase.
Collectively these source stamps are called <em>source stamp set</em> for each project.</p>
<img alt="Source Stamp Sets" src="../_images/changes.svg" /></div>
<div class="section" id="version-control-systems">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Version Control Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot supports a significant number of version control systems, so it treats them abstractly.</p>
<p>For purposes of deciding when to perform builds, Buildbot’s change sources monitor repositories, and represent any updates to those repositories as <em>changes</em>.
These change sources fall broadly into two categories: pollers which periodically check the repository for updates; and hooks, where the repository is configured to notify Buildbot whenever an update occurs.
For more information see <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/changesources.html#change-sources"><span class="std std-ref">Change Sources and Changes</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/changesources.html#how-different-vc-systems-specify-sources"><span class="std std-ref">How Different VC Systems Specify Sources</span></a>.</p>
<p>When it comes time to actually perform a build, a scheduler prepares a source stamp set, as described above, based on its configuration.
When the build begins, one or more source steps use the information in the source stamp set to actually check out the source code, using the normal VCS commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changes">
<span id="concept-changes"></span><h2>Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/changesources.html#change-attrs"><span class="std std-ref">Change</span></a> is an abstract way Buildbot uses to represent a single change to the source files performed by a developer.
In version control systems that support the notion of atomic check-ins a change represents a changeset or commit.</p>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Change</span></code> comprises the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>the developer that is responsible for the change</p></li>
<li><p>the list of files that the change added, removed or modified</p></li>
<li><p>the message of the commit</p></li>
<li><p>the repository, the codebase and the project that the change corresponds to</p></li>
<li><p>the revision and the branch of the commit</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scheduling-builds">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Scheduling Builds<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-builds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each Buildmaster has a set of scheduler objects, each of which gets a copy of every incoming <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Change</span></code>.
The Schedulers are responsible for deciding when <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Build</span></code>s should be run.
Some Buildbot installations might have a single scheduler, while others may have several, each for a different purpose.</p>
<p>For example, a <em>quick</em> scheduler might exist to give immediate feedback to developers, hoping to catch obvious problems in the code that can be detected quickly.
These typically do not run the full test suite, nor do they run on a wide variety of platforms.
They also usually do a VC update rather than performing a brand-new checkout each time.</p>
<p>A separate <em>full</em> scheduler might run more comprehensive tests, to catch more subtle problems.
It might be configured to run after the quick scheduler, to give developers time to commit fixes to bugs caught by the quick scheduler before running the comprehensive tests.
This scheduler would also feed multiple <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code>s.</p>
<p>Many schedulers can be configured to wait a while after seeing a source-code change - this is the <em>tree stable timer</em>.
The timer allows multiple commits to be “batched” together.
This is particularly useful in distributed version control systems, where a developer may push a long sequence of changes all at once.
To save resources, it’s often desirable only to test the most recent change.</p>
<p>Schedulers can also filter out the changes they are interested in, based on a number of criteria.
For example, a scheduler that only builds documentation might skip any changes that do not affect the documentation.
Schedulers can also filter on the branch to which a commit was made.</p>
<p>There is some support for configuring dependencies between builds - for example, you may want to build packages only for revisions which pass all of the unit tests.
This support is under active development in Buildbot, and is referred to as “build coordination”.</p>
<p>Periodic builds (those which are run every N seconds rather than after new Changes arrive) are triggered by a special <a href="#id4"><span class="problematic" id="id5">:bb:sched:`Periodic`</span></a> scheduler.</p>
<p>Each scheduler creates and submits <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></code> objects to the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildMaster</span></code>, which is then responsible for making sure the individual <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequests</span></code> are delivered to the target <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code>s.</p>
<p>Scheduler instances are activated by placing them in the <a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">:bb:cfg:`schedulers`</span></a> list in the buildmaster config file.
Each scheduler must have a unique name.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="builds">
<span id="concepts-build"></span><h2>Builds<a class="headerlink" href="#builds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Build</span></code> represents a single compile or test run of a particular version of the source code.
A build is comprised of a series of steps.
The steps may be arbitrary. For example, for compiled software a build generally consists of the checkout, configure, make, and make check sequence.
For interpreted projects like Python modules, a build is generally a checkout followed by an invocation of the bundled test suite.</p>
<p>Builds are created by instances of <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> (see below).
A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildFactory</span></code> (see below) that is attached to the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> creates a list of the steps for the new build.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="buildsets">
<span id="concepts-buildset"></span><h2>BuildSets<a class="headerlink" href="#buildsets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildSet</span></code> represents a set of potentially not yet created <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Build</span></code>s that all compile and/or test the same version of the source tree.
It tracks whether this set of builds as a whole succeeded or not.
The information that is stored in a BuildSet is a set of <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></code>s which define the version of the code to test and a set of <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code>s which define what builds to create.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="buildrequests">
<span id="buildrequest"></span><h2>BuildRequests<a class="headerlink" href="#buildrequests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code> is a request to start a specific build.
A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code> consists of the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>the name of the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> (see below) that will start the build.</p></li>
<li><p>the set of <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SourceStamp</span></code>s (see above) that specify the version of the source tree to build and/or test.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code> may be merged with another <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code> if they represent the same version of the source code and the same builder.
The user may configure additional restrictions for determining mergeability of build requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="builders-and-build-factories">
<span id="concepts-build-factories"></span><span id="builder"></span><h2>Builders and Build Factories<a class="headerlink" href="#builders-and-build-factories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> is responsible for creating new builds from <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code>s.
Creating a new build is essentially determining the exact steps and other properties of the build and/or test sequence to execute.
This is performed by a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildFactory</span></code> that is attached to each <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code>.</p>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> will attempt to create a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Build</span></code> from a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code> as soon as it is possible, that is, as soon as the associated worker becomes free.
When a worker becomes free, the build master will select the oldest <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildRequest</span></code> that can run on that worker and notify the corresponding <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> to maybe start a build out of it.</p>
<p>Each <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> by default runs completely independently.
This means, that a worker that has N builders attached to it, may potentially attempt to run N builds concurrently.
This level of concurrency may be controlled by various kinds of <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/interlocks.html#interlocks"><span class="std std-ref">Interlocks</span></a>.</p>
<p>At a low level, each builder has its own exclusive directory on the build master and one exclusive directory on each of the workers it is attached to.
The directory on the master is used for keeping status information.
The directories on the workers are used as a location where the actual checkout, compilation and testing steps happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workers">
<span id="concepts-workers"></span><h2>Workers<a class="headerlink" href="#workers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Worker</span></code> corresponds to an environment where builds are executed.
A single physical machine must run at least one <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Worker</span></code> in order for Buildbot to be able to utilize it for running builds.
Multiple <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Worker</span></code>s may run on a single machine to provide different environments that can reuse the same hardware by means of containers or virtual machines.</p>
<p>Each builder is associated with one or more <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Worker</span></code>s.
For example, a builder which is used to perform macOS builds (as opposed to Linux or Windows builds) should naturally be associated with a Mac worker.</p>
<p>If multiple workers are available for any given builder, you will have some measure of redundancy: in case one worker goes offline, the others can still keep the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> working.
In addition, multiple workers will allow multiple simultaneous builds for the same <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code>, which might be useful if you have a lot of forced or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try</span></code> builds taking place.</p>
<p>Ideally, each <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Worker</span></code> that is configured for a builder should be identical.
Otherwise build or test failures will be dependent on which worker the build is ran and this will complicate investigation of failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="users">
<span id="concepts-users"></span><h2>Users<a class="headerlink" href="#users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buildbot has a somewhat limited awareness of <em>users</em>.
It assumes the world consists of a set of developers, each of whom can be described by a couple of simple attributes.
These developers make changes to the source code, causing builds which may succeed or fail.</p>
<p>Users also may have different levels of authorization when issuing Buildbot commands, such as forcing a build from the web interface or from an IRC channel.</p>
<p>Each developer is primarily known through the source control system.
Each <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Change</span></code> object that arrives is tagged with a <code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">who</span></code> field that typically gives the account name (on the repository machine) of the user responsible for that change.
This string is displayed on the HTML status pages and in each <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Build</span></code>’s <em>blamelist</em>.</p>
<p>To do more with the User than just refer to them, this username needs to be mapped into an address of some sort.
The responsibility for this mapping is left up to the status module which needs the address.
In the future, the responsibility for managing users will be transferred to User Objects.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">who</span></code> fields in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span></code> Changes are used to create <a class="reference internal" href="#user-objects"><span class="std std-ref">User Objects</span></a>, which allows for more control and flexibility in how Buildbot manages users.</p>
<div class="section" id="user-objects">
<span id="id8"></span><h3>User Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#user-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>User Objects allow Buildbot to better manage users throughout its various interactions with users (see <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/changesources.html#change-sources"><span class="std std-ref">Change Sources and Changes</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/reporters.html#reporters"><span class="std std-ref">Reporters</span></a>).
The User Objects are stored in the Buildbot database and correlate the various attributes that a user might have: irc, Git, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="id9">
<h4>Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#id9" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Incoming Changes all have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">who</span></code> attribute attached to them that specifies which developer is responsible for that Change.
When a Change is first rendered, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">who</span></code> attribute is parsed and added to the database if it doesn’t exist or checked against an existing user.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">who</span></code> attribute is formatted in different ways depending on the version control system that the Change came from.</p>

<p>Correlating the various bits and pieces that Buildbot views as users also means that one attribute of a user can be translated into another.

<p>One such use is being able to find email addresses based on a set of Builds to notify users through the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code>.
This process is explained more clearly in <a class="reference internal" href="#email-addresses"><span class="std std-ref">Email Addresses</span></a>.</p>
<p>Another way to utilize <cite>User Objects</cite> is through <cite>UsersAuth</cite> for web authentication.
To use <cite>UsersAuth</cite>, you need to set a <cite>bb_username</cite> and <cite>bb_password</cite> via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">buildbot</span> <span class="pre">user</span></code> command line tool to check against.

<p>Each change has a single user who is responsible for it.
Most builds have a set of changes: the build generally represents the first time these changes have been built and tested by the Buildbot.
The build has a <em>blamelist</em> that is the union of the users responsible for all the build’s changes.
If the build was created by a <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/schedulers.html#try-schedulers"><span class="std std-ref">Try Schedulers</span></a> this list will include the submitter of the try job, if known.</p>
<p>The build provides a list of users who are interested in the build – the <em>interested users</em>.
Usually this is equal to the blamelist, but may also be expanded, e.g., to include the current build sherrif or a module’s maintainer.</p>
<p>If desired, the buildbot can notify the interested users until the problem is resolved.</p>

<p>The <a href="#id12"><span class="problematic" id="id13">:bb:reporter:`MailNotifier`</span></a> is a status target which can send email about the results of each build.
It accepts a static list of email addresses to which each message should be delivered, but it can also be configured to send mail to the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Build</span></code>’s Interested Users.
To do this, it needs a way to convert User names into email addresses.</p>
<p>For many VC systems, the User Name is actually an account name on the system which hosts the repository.
As such, turning the name into an email address is a simple matter of appending <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;repositoryhost.com</span></code>.
Some projects use other kinds of mappings (for example the preferred email address may be at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">project.org</span></code> despite the repository host being named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cvs.project.org</span></code>), and some VC systems have full separation between the concept of a user and that of an account on the repository host (like Perforce).
Some systems (like Git) put a full contact email address in every change.</p>
<p>To convert these names to addresses, the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code> uses an <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EmailLookup</span></code> object.
This provides a <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getAddress()</span></code> method which accepts a name and (eventually) returns an address.
The default <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code> module provides an <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">EmailLookup</span></code> which simply appends a static string, configurable when the notifier is created.
To create more complex behaviors (perhaps using an LDAP lookup, or using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">finger</span></code> on a central host to determine a preferred address for the developer), provide a different object as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lookup</span></code> argument.</p>
<p>If an EmailLookup object isn’t given to the MailNotifier, the MailNotifier will try to find emails through <a class="reference internal" href="#user-objects"><span class="std std-ref">User Objects</span></a>.
This will work the same as if an EmailLookup object was used if every user in the Build’s Interested Users list has an email in the database for them.
If a user whose change led to a Build doesn’t have an email attribute, that user will not receive an email.
If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extraRecipients</span></code> is given, those users are still sent mail when the EmailLookup object is not specified.</p>
<p>In the future, when the Problem mechanism has been set up, the Buildbot will need to send mail to arbitrary Users.
It will do this by locating a <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code>-like object among all the buildmaster’s status targets, and asking it to send messages to various Users.
This means the User-to-address mapping only has to be set up once, in your <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code>, and every email message the buildbot emits will take advantage of it.</p>

<div class="section" id="irc-nicknames">

<p>Like <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code>, the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">buildbot.status.words.IRC</span></code> class provides a status target which can announce the results of each build.
It also provides an interactive interface by responding to online queries posted in the channel or sent as private messages.</p>
<p>In the future, the buildbot can be configured to map User names to IRC nicknames, to watch for the recent presence of these nicknames, and to deliver build status messages to the interested parties.
Like <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MailNotifier</span></code> does for email addresses, the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IRC</span></code> object will have an <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IRCLookup</span></code> which is responsible for nicknames.
The mapping can be set up statically, or it can be updated by online users themselves (by claiming a username with some kind of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">buildbot:</span> <span class="pre">i</span> <span class="pre">am</span> <span class="pre">user</span> <span class="pre">warner</span></code> commands).</p>
<p>Once the mapping is established, the rest of the buildbot can ask the <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IRC</span></code> object to send messages to various users.
It can report on the likelihood that the user saw the given message (based upon how long the user has been inactive on the channel), which might prompt the Problem Hassler logic to send them an email message instead.</p>
<p>These operations and authentication of commands issued by particular nicknames will be implemented in <a class="reference internal" href="#user-objects"><span class="std std-ref">User Objects</span></a>.</p>

<span id="index-0"></span><span id="id15"></span><h2>Build Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#build-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each build has a set of <em>Build Properties</em>, which can be used by its build steps to modify their actions.</p>
<p>The properties are represented as a set of key-value pairs.
Effectively, a single property is a variable that, once set, can be used by subsequent steps in a build to modify their behaviour.
The value of a property can be a number, a string, a list or a dictionary.
Lists and dictionaries can contain other lists or dictionaries.
Thus, the value of a property could be arbitrarily complex structure.</p>
<p>Properties work pretty much like variables, so they can be used to implement all manner of functionality.</p>
<p>The following are several examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>By default, the name of the worker that runs the build is set to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workername</span></code> property.
If there are multiple different workers and the actions of the build depend on the exact worker, some users may decide that it’s more convenient to vary the actions depending on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workername</span></code> property instead of creating separate builders for each worker.</p></li>
<li><p>In most cases the build does not know the exact code revision that will be tested until it checks out the code.
This information is only known after a <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/buildsteps.html#source-checkout"><span class="std std-ref">source step</span></a> runs.
To give this information to the subsequent steps, the source step records the checked out revision into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">got_revision</span></code> property.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<div class="section" id="multiple-codebase-builds">
<span id="id16"></span><h2>Multiple-Codebase Builds<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-codebase-builds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>What if an end-product is composed of code from several codebases?
Changes may arrive from different repositories within the tree-stable-timer period.
Buildbot will not only use the source-trees that contain changes but also needs the remaining source-trees to build the complete product.</p>
<p>For this reason a <a class="reference internal" href="#scheduling-builds"><span class="std std-ref">Scheduler</span></a> can be configured to base a build on a set of several source-trees that can (partly) be overridden by the information from incoming <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Change</span></code>s.</p>
<p>As described <a class="reference internal" href="#source-stamps"><span class="std std-ref">above</span></a>, the source for each codebase is identified by a source stamp, containing its repository, branch and revision.
A full build set will specify a source stamp set describing the source to use for each codebase.</p>
<p>Configuring all of this takes a coordinated approach.  A complete multiple repository configuration consists of:</p>
<p>a <em>codebase generator</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Every relevant change arriving from a VC must contain a codebase.
This is done by a <a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">:bb:cfg:`codebaseGenerator`</span></a> that is defined in the configuration.
Most generators examine the repository of a change to determine its codebase, using project-specific rules.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>some <em>schedulers</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Each <a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">:bb:cfg:`scheduler&lt;schedulers&gt;`</span></a> has to be configured with a set of all required <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">codebases</span></code> to build a product.
These codebases indicate the set of required source-trees.
In order for the scheduler to be able to produce a complete set for each build, the configuration can give a default repository, branch, and revision for each codebase.
When a scheduler must generate a source stamp for a codebase that has received no changes, it applies these default values.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>multiple <em>source steps</em> - one for each codebase</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A <a class="reference internal" href="#builder"><span class="std std-ref">Builders and Build Factories</span></a>’s build factory must include a <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/buildsteps.html#source-checkout"><span class="std std-ref">source step</span></a> for each codebase.
Each of the source steps has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">codebase</span></code> attribute which is used to select an appropriate source stamp from the source stamp set for a build.
This information comes from the arrived changes or from the scheduler’s configured default values.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>

<p>Buildbot Multimaster is considered experimental.
There are still some companies using it in production.
Don’t hesitate to use the mailing lists to share your experience.</p>
</div>
<p>Buildbot supports interconnection of several masters.
This has to be done through a multi-master enabled message queue backend.
As of now the only one supported is wamp and crossbar.io.
see <a class="reference internal" href="configuration/global.html#mq-specification"><span class="std std-ref">wamp</span></a></p>
<p>There are then several strategy for introducing multimaster in your buildbot infra.
A simple way to say it is by adding the concept of symmetrics and asymmetrics multimaster (like there is SMP and AMP for multi core CPUs)</p>
<p>Symmetric multimaster is when each master share the exact same configuration. They run the same builders, same schedulers, same everything, the only difference is that workers are connected evenly between the masters (by any means (e.g. DNS load balancing, etc)) Symmetric multimaster is good to use to scale buildbot horizontally.</p>
<p>Asymmetric multimaster is when each master have different configuration. Each master may have a specific responsibility (e.g schedulers, set of builder, UI). This was more how you did in 0.8, also because of its own technical limitations. A nice feature of asymmetric multimaster is that you can have the UI only handled by some masters.</p>
<p>Separating the UI from the controlling will greatly help in the performance of the UI, because badly written BuildSteps?? can stall the reactor for several seconds.</p>
<p>The fanciest configuration would probably be a symmetric configuration for everything but the UI.
You would scale the number of UI master according to your number of UI users, and scale the number of engine masters to the number of workers.</p>
<p>Depending on your workload and size of master host, it is probably a good idea to start thinking of multimaster starting from a hundred workers connected.</p>
<p>Multimaster can also be used for high availability, and seamless upgrade of configuration code.
Complex configuration indeed requires sometimes to restart the master to reload custom steps or code, or just to upgrade the upstream buildbot version.</p>
<p>In this case, you will implement following procedure:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Start new master(s) with new code and configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a graceful shutdown to the old master(s).</p></li>
<li><p>New master(s) will start taking the new jobs, while old master(s) will just finish managing the running builds.</p></li>
<li><p>As an old master is finishing the running builds, it will drop the connections from the workers, who will then reconnect automatically, and by the mean of load balancer will get connected to a new master to run new jobs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As buildbot nine has been designed to allow such procedure, it has not been implemented in production yet as we know.
There is probably a new REST api needed in order to graceful shutdown a master, and the details of gracefully dropping the connection to the workers to be sorted out.</p>
